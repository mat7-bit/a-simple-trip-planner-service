## Assumptions

During the development of this project, several assumptions were made. This page summarizes the most significant ones.

### Wrapped APIs

The wrapped API behind the basic `GET /trips` is a potential weak point in terms of performance. The service depends on an external API, which should not be called synchronously. However, based on the endpoint definition, I assumed that the API must be called in real time to deliver the expected results.

To mitigate the coupling with the background service and improve the application's scalability, I recommend discussing the addition of a caching layer (e.g., in-memory, Redis, or similar) in front of the HTTP call. I chose not to implement a caching system directly because the API response includes fields that may change frequently (e.g., trip cost or duration).

### Manager APIs

The basic manager APIs rely on a PostgreSQL database configuration. While the database setup process should be straightforward if you follow the instructions in the README, it still requires some initial configuration. I opted to implement a persistent system with a complete database example, as I believe it provides a better real-world demonstration compared to alternatives like an in-memory database or SQLite.

### No authentication

Due to the nature of this project, I did not implement any authentication method. Basic authentication is insufficient for covering the entire applicationâ€™s behavior because it lacks user identification. Consequently, any user with the same authentication token would have unrestricted access to the entire database.
To address this, a more advanced security system should be implemented to identify users and restrict CRUD operations to their own data. However, since implementing a comprehensive security system is beyond the scope of this demo project, I chose to leave it for future development.
